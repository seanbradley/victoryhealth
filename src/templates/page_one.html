    <h2>ReadableStream</h2>
    <p>
      From MDN:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The <code>ReadableStream</code> interface of the Streams API represents a readable stream of byte data. The Fetch
      API offers a concrete instance of a <code>ReadableStream</code> through the <code>body</code> property of a
      <code>Response</code> object.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A prime use-case for <code>ReadableStream</code> is as the content of a <code>Response</code> object. This enables
      developers to construct a streaming response and serve this to the browser through a Service Worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the core functionality of this app.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>ReadableStream</code> is supported by all modern browsers.

      In this demo, the header, footer and content are fetched as separate templates. All template responses have a
      <code>body</code> property which exposes the underlying stream. For each of these streams we get a reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, a new <code>ReadableStream</code> is constructed that is immediately returned to the browser. When the
      readers of the individual template streams return a chunk, this is enqueued in the new
      <code>ReadableStream</code> which then immediately serves that content to the browser.
